# 2048-Game-in-Python-with-GUI-NumPy-and-Tkinter-
This Python code implements the 2048 game using NumPy and Tkinter for a GUI. It includes board initialization, movement (up, down, left, right), tile merging, random tile generation, and game state checks for win/loss. The GUI updates dynamically with colored tiles based on their values. Arrow keys control gameplay.
